## v0.2.0

### Fixed
- Addressed missing code comments in `SimpleWebApp/app.py` to improve code readability and maintainability, as reported in GitHub issue #1.

### Added
- Introduced a new test suite for the `SimpleWebApp` application, located in `SimpleWebApp/tests/test_app.py`.
- The test suite provides coverage for all application routes:
    - `GET /`: Checks for a successful response and verifies the content of the index page.
    - `GET /about`: Checks for a successful response and verifies the content of the about page.
    - `GET /contact`: Checks for a successful response and verifies the content of the contact page.
    - `POST /contact`: Tests the contact form submission and verifies the success message.
